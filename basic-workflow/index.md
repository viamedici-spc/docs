# 5 The basic configuration workflow
Before a [*Configuration Dialogue*](/glossary/terms-infrastructure/#configuration-dialogue) can begin,
the prerequisites must be created on the server side.
A [*Configuration Session*](/glossary/terms-infrastructure/#configuration-session)
is therefore created with an initial POST request and the
[*Configuration Model*](/glossary/terms-modelling/#configuration-model) to be used is activated.

The important question of whether or not
[*Configuration Rules*](/glossary/terms-modelling/#configuration-rule) should be included in an
[*Explanation Response*](/glossary/terms-state/#explanation-response) alongside
Attributes is also decided during initialization.

Optionally, [*Usage Rules*](/glossary/terms-modelling/#usage-rule) and
[*Attribute Relations*](/glossary/terms-modelling/#attribute-relations) can be announced
in the session.
