## 3.1 Configuration usage scenario without components

In this usage scenario, two simple Configurators are required, one for passenger cars (shortly "cars")
and one for trucks. A truck has one specific property:
"Sleeping cabin" with the values "1 bed" and "2 beds". A car has two
specific properties: "CO2 Emissions" with values between 0 and 300 gram per kilometer and
"Over size" with the values YES or NO. The following properties apply to both types of vehicles:
* Construction (Car, Truck)
* Engine type (Burner, Electric)
* Chassis type (Sport, Comfort)
* Transmission type (Manual, Automatic)
* Rim size (16 inch, 18 inch, 25 inch, 28 inch)
