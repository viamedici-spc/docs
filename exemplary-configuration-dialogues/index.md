# 6 Exemplary Configuration Dialogues

Two [*Configuration Dialogues*](/glossary/#configuration-dialogue) of varying complexity are described:
in Chapter 6.1, a very simple one without the use of components, and in Chapter 6.2,
the powerful concept of [*Component Configuration Models*](/glossary/#component-configuration-model) is
demonstrated using a somewhat more complex Configuration Dialogue.
