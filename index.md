# Documentation of the Headless Configuration API 2.0 of Viamedici
## Why to read it
[*Configurators*](/glossary/#configurator) can be built very easily with the help of the Headless Configuration API
([*HCA*](/glossary/#hca)).
However, behind the simplicity lies a complexity that must be understood if you want to achieve optimum results.
Knowledge of the technical terms used and of the interrelationships is a prerequisite for a good understanding.
That's why it's recommended to read this documentation.
## How to read it
The chapters of the documentation do not necessarily have to be read in a specific order.
However, to get started, it is recommended that you read the chapters in their numbered order.
The glossary terms are divided into three sections according to relevant aspects.
All terms can be accessed from the chapter texts via cross-references.
