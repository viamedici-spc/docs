## 7. Restore a Configuration State
A common use case is loading a saved, valid [*Configuration State*](/glossary/terms-state/#configuration-state).
‘Valid’ means that the [*Configuration Model-Satisfaction State*](/glossary/terms-state/#configuration-model-satisfaction-state)
is TRUE.

Problems can occur if the [*Configuration Model*](/glossary/terms-modelling/#configuration-model) has been changed in the meantime.
Changes to the Configuration Model that can lead to an invalid Configuration State after restoring are described in subsection 7.2.
